### About

The focus of this book is to provide an introduction to the skills and knowledge
necessary to start developing games in Javascript.  Some of the concepts here
are simply related to the Javascript language while others are related to game
development in general.  The book will provide tips and tricks along with code
examples in each section with links to live examples that you can edit and play
with.  Many thanks to all my friends on Khan Academy who are kind and gracious,
helping and encouraging me and one another.  Keep on gaming everyone!

### Learning Philosophy
Out of all of our endeavors, learning is perhaps the most important.  In each
new subject that we choose to learn about, we all find that we are new,
unacquainted and out of place at first.  But soon with a few descriptions, some
examples and experimentation and discovery we begin to harness the skills
necessary to master the subject at hand.  This is true for all new endeavors
and as such we are **all beginners** when we start something new.  For me
personally, attempting to write a book is a new experience, something I have
never done before.  So the title of this book is fitting for myself as well as
it may be for you, the reader.

Likewise the learning philosophy in this book
is for _beginners_ like you and me.  I shall do my best to give as much
explanation as is necessary to help you along with any concepts that may be new
to you, but I will try NOT to give MORE information than is necessary so as not
to confuse the reader ( as well as confusing myself ).  I may fall short of this
goal on occasion and if I do, please let me know on the Khan Academy version of
this book in the Tips and Thanks or file an issue on the github project ( this
books archive ) at <a class="external" href="https://github.com/EricBalingit/game-programming-md">https://github.com/EricBalingit/game-programming-md</a>.

### Who This Book is For
This book is written for learners ( all beginners ) from beginner level to
advanced knowledge of Javascript and game programming.  This is not meant to be
an all-in-one guide to game programming, but touches on basic concepts and
knowledge that I have found are quite useful across a broad range of problems
that one may encounter during game programming, design and development.  If you
are brand new to Javascript and game programming, I would recommend starting
on Part 1 Chapter 1 and reading through to Chapter 3, while experimenting with
the examples before moving on to Part 2 Game Programming.  If you have some
experience with Javascript or have written a few games before, you may benefit
from advanced concepts in Object Oriented Programming in Chapter 3 before moving
on to Game Programming in Part 2, however keep in mind that advanced OOP is
meant to aid in more complex design at a higher level and Game Engines must
be kept small and streamlined for efficiency at the low level which can be slow
if the code must work with complex objects or structures.  As stated before in
this books [Learning Philosophy](#forward-1) if there is any way I can improve
your read of this material please let me know at the locations provided there.
